# Squib

Squib is a modern display font that supports a generous 169 glyphs. The name derives from &#x201c;square&#x201d; and &#x201c;slab&#x201d;. To see it in action, please visit the [http://foundry.heydonworks.com/squib](Squib demo page).

Squib is free under the Open Font License (OFL) so, should you wish to make a new font using it as a base, please fork and change the new font's reserved name (both in the `.ttf`'s metadata and the `license.txt` file).
